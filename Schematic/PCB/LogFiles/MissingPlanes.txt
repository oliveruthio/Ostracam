The following is a list of layer(s) with plane net(s) that
do not have plane metal generated for them.  Enter the Planes

Run Batch DRC verification before producing manufacturing
outputs.  Dynamic Area Fills may give the appearance of the
planes being generated, therefore this option may need to be
turned off.
